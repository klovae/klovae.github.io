It feels unreal to be writing a post for this blog 5 years to the date after [def greeting](http://elyseklova.com/2016/05/04/def_greeting.html). In the time since I started Flatiron School's Self-Paced Software Engineering Program:

* I moved from Houston, TX to Charleston, SC
* I moved from Charleston back to my hometown of choice, Atlanta
* I started a [leadership development company](https://blazeleadership.co) with my former boss from my first-ever job
* We created and launched a leadership assessment that I [coded myself](https://trailblazerstest.co) (thanks to Flatiron)!
* My partner and I bought our first house in the middle of a pandemic
* Said pandemic swept through like a literal plague and changed everything about how we live and work

When I started this program, I was coming off a job in the nonprofit sector and I wasn't sure what was next for me. I knew I wanted to make things, and learning software development seemed like a really smart move towards that end. And even though my primary work is with my company, knowing how to code has become more important than ever, for my own satisfaction as well as the benefit of my firm.

To that end, let's get to talking about my Rails Project.

In a lot of ways, my Rails project builds on the learning from my [Sinatra Project](http://elyseklova.com/2017/02/16/making_a_sinatra_app_bujo_2_0.html). I built a digital version of the bulleted to-do list system that has become ubiquitous in the last 5 years or so. While I was getting back on the horse with coding and solidifying my knowledge of Rails, I actually [fully redid my Sinatra app](https://github.com/klovae/bujo-3-point-0) in Rails before moving on to my official project domain, a light project management system.
